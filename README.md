# Clchat
Clchat is a command line chat (i know the name has been used i could not think of another name)
##  Setting up a server
First you need to host it somewhere and if you followed the steps the program gave you in the place that you hosted it you should see a server.ini file

In that file are the settings change the ip to the url / ip of the server then create a github repo with the server.ini at the master level

(The repo can be filled with other stuff but make sure that the server.ini is at root level)

Then when you want to connect simply run the client script and then where it asks for the server you input the path to the github repo like python/typing

(Not github.com/python/typing) and it should connect.
## Running a server on localhost
Its all the ame as setting up a server except you don't need to set up a repo or change the server.ini file to connect you just type Artyuicraft/localchatserver
(Also make sure that port is 26676)
